          <article>
            <p>My name is Matthew Carson. I am an aspiring web developer who loves the idea of being able to use technology to solve both simple and complex problems.</p>
  
            <p>I was first introduced to web development while I attended Temple University from 2007 until 2012, where I graduated with a B.B.A. in Management Information Systems and Accounting. Recently, after feeling dissatisfied with my career trajectory, I rediscovered my passion for web development and recommitted myself to learning it in order to pursue a more fulfilling and gratifying career.</p>
              
            <p>I have been learning web development for the past two years over which I have greatly increased my knowledge of PHP, specifically the Laravel MVC framework, as well as JavaScript, using the Vue.js front-end framework (which I used for this site). Currently I am working on gaining greater familiarity with content management systems such as Wordpress and Drupal.</p>
              
            <p>When I'm not trying to figure out regular expressions, I'm usually either reading fantasy novels and biographies or walking my pitbull, Duchess. In meiner Freizeit, lerne ich auch gern Deutsch.</p>
              
            <p>I am currently located in the Philadelphia area.</p>
